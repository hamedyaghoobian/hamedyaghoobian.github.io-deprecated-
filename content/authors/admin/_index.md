I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Muhlenberg College. My teaching and research interests lie in the interstices of Natural Language Processing and Human-Computer Interaction, primarily focusing on computer- and AI-mediated practices in everyday life. For pronunciation clarity, my last name sounds like /Yah-KOO-bee-an/. 

Originally from Mashhad, Iran, I now reside in Allentown, PA, alongside my wife.

For discussions, collaborations, or just a friendly chat, drop me an email at [hamedyaghoobian@muhlenberg.edu](mailto:hamedyaghoobian@muhlenberg.edu) or visit me in the Trumbower Science Building, room 143. 

On a side note, I'm shifting my primary social media presence from Twitter to Mastodon, in line with the evolving digital landscape. Join me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@postgrammar">Mastodon</a> for updates.
