My research interests are in studying computer-mediated practices in everyday life, textual analytics, and integrating Critical Theory into the field of Computer Science.

I was born and raised in Mashhad, Iran and studied Electrical Engineering before joining UGA. My last name is pronounced /ya-KOO-bee-un/.
