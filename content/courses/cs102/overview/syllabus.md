An introduction to Computer Science (CS) through the programming of games. Emphasis is placed on the creation of arcade style games incorporating animation, user interaction, and sound effects. Students learn to use game development, audio, and image manipulation software in
designing and constructing their games. The course is intended for those with *no prior experience in computer science* but with a desire to hone
problem solving and computational thinking skills with a focus on game programming.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of CSI 102, you will be able to:

-   use problem-solving methods to develop and implement algorithms
    using Python,

-   implement programs using the tools, abilities and concepts provided
    by Python -- a widely used, structured programming language,

-   use features provided by [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to extend
    the capabilities of Python,

-   apply methods and algorithms to the basic techniques of game design
    and implementation,

-   collaborate effectively with colleagues to accomplish specific
    goals,

-   design, code, debug, and document programs using good practices of
    programming style and structure.

## Course Policies
### Attendance Policy
> *Showing up is 80 percent of life* --- Woody Allen, via [Marshall
Brickman](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/#note-6553-1)

Attendance is not directly recorded. However, it is counted toward your grade for participation. Missing discussions may affect your projects' quality, papers, and thus your total grade indirectly. I assume you are enrolled because you are interested in the topic and wish to learn.
Therefore, I assume you will not skip class frivolously. I will work with you to address conflicts and emergencies on a case-by-case basis
but expect you to attend class. Participation hinges on engaging thoughtfully with the readings and your peers' analysis of them. Please notify me before the scheduled class time if you must miss a class, and
I will consider ways in which you may compensate for your absence.

### Email Policy
I try to be quick in responding to emails. However, please allow up to 24 hrs for a reply on workdays.

#### Academic Honesty Policy
We are required to abide by [Muhlenberg's Academic Integrity Code](https://www.muhlenberg.edu/offices/deanofacademiclife/integrity/).

| :point_up: If you use other material to support your own, make sure to cite the source properly. If you are unsure as to what constitutes plagiarism, please contact me before submitting your assignment. |

#### Laptop & Technology Statement

You will need a computer to do the assignments. We will be using e-devices in different capacities in class. Please make sure to silenceÂ your e-devices during the meetings.

#### Disabilities Policy
If you are a student with a disability or health-related issue who needs class accommodation, please make sure to complete a multi-faceted determination process through the [Office of Disability Services](https://www.muhlenberg.edu/offices/disabilities/) prior to the development and implementation of accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services. Each Accommodation Plan is individually and collaboratively developed between the student and the Office of Disability Services. If you have not already done so, please contact them.

#### Syllabus Policy
This course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
