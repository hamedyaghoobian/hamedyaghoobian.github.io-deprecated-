There is nothing probably more intensely connected, more distant, compulsory, and more strategically organized than a computer network. This course serves as an introduction to fundamental concepts of computer networks and widely used networking technologies. Topics include application protocol design, principles of congestion and error control protocols, network routing, local, wireless, and access networks, network security, and networking programming. We will utilize programming and written assignments toward maximizing engagement with networking concepts.

## Course Policies
### Attendance Policy
> *Showing up is 80 percent of life* --- Woody Allen, via [Marshall
Brickman](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/#note-6553-1)

Attendance is not directly recorded. However, it is counted toward your grade for participation. Missing discussions may affect your projects' quality, papers, and thus your total grade indirectly. I assume you are enrolled because you are interested in the topic and wish to learn.
Therefore, I assume you will not skip class frivolously. I will work with you to address conflicts and emergencies on a case-by-case basis
but expect you to attend class. Participation hinges on engaging thoughtfully with the readings and your peers' analysis of them. Please notify me before the scheduled class time if you must miss a class, and
I will consider ways in which you may compensate for your absence.

### Email Policy
I try to be quick in responding to emails. However, please allow up to 24 hrs for a reply on workdays.

#### Academic Honesty Policy
We are required to abide by [Muhlenberg's Academic Integrity Code](https://www.muhlenberg.edu/offices/deanofacademiclife/integrity/).

TL;DR: **If you use other material to support your own, make sure to cite the source properly**. If you are unsure as to what constitutes plagiarism, please contact me before submitting your assignment.

#### Laptop & Technology Statement

You will need a computer to do the assignments. We will be using e-devices in different capacities in class. Please make sure to silenceÂ your e-devices during the meetings.

#### Disabilities Policy
If you are a student with a disability or health-related issue who needs class accommodation, please make sure to complete a multi-faceted determination process through the [Office of Disability Services](https://www.muhlenberg.edu/offices/disabilities/) prior to the development and implementation of accommodations, auxiliary aids, and services. Each Accommodation Plan is individually and collaboratively developed between the student and the Office of Disability Services. If you have not already done so, please contact them.

#### Syllabus Policy
This course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
