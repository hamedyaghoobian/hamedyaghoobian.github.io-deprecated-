The HINT (Human-Interaction and Technology) Lab is a small research group at Muhlenberg focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human-AI Interaction (HAII). The mission is to conduct innovative research that advances the understanding of human interactions with technology and explores the potential of AI to enhance human experience.

Our research areas include:

* NLP for text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling
* Conversational agents
* Human-centered design and evaluation of AI systems
* Ethical considerations and philosophical issues related to AI and technology

This stream of research involves quantitative analysis and requires strong programming skills, particularly in Python. Familiarity with machine learning and artificial intelligence models is also preferred. Students who are interested in joining HINT Lab should be motivated, independent, and eager to learn.

If you are a Muhlenberg student who is passionate about exploring the potential of AI and technology to enhance human experience, I invite you to join us at HINT Lab. You will have the opportunity to work on projects, develop critical research skills, and contribute to research in the field of NLP and HAII. Contact me to learn more about our research opportunities and how to get involved.
