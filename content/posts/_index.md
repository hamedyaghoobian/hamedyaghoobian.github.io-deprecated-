_Muhlenberg students interested in research in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP), or Human-computer Interaction (HCI) are encouraged to contact me for **Independent Study** and/or **Summer Research Assistant**. For quantitative research, solid programming skills (mostly Python) are required; familiarity with machine learning and artificial intelligence models is preferred._
