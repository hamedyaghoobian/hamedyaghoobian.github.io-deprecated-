The +Tech Lab at Muhlenberg serves as a platform for studying Language Models and Human-AI Interaction (HAII). It is a space for independent inquiry rather than a fully formed research group, intended to foster self-motivated students interested in the nexus of AI and human experience. We aim to examine how humans and technology shape each other and to scrutinize the place of AI within this interplay.

The focus of the +Tech Lab includes:

* NLP for text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling
* Understanding and refining conversational agents
* Human-focused design and evaluation of AI systems
* Reflection on ethical considerations and philosophical matters tied to AI and technology

Our approach calls for a strong foundation in programming, especially in Python, and an interest in quantitative analysis. Familiarity with machine learning and AI models is beneficial. Students who consider undertaking their term-long senior projects under the guidance of the +Tech Lab should be self-starters, ready to delve into the intricate relationship between humans, data, and technology. 

If you are a Muhlenberg undergraduate in Computer Science and you're drawn to the exploration of AI, technology, and their influence on human experience, the +Tech Lab offers a platform for your curiosity. You will independently work on insightful projects, hone your research skills, and contribute to our understanding of NLP and HAII. Reach out to learn more about how you can shape your project within the +Tech Lab.
