# Introduction
German philosopher and critical theorist Walter Benjamin (1892-1940) was famously known for his avid letter writing habit. The surviving letters were compiled in a book titled "The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin, 1910-1940" by the University of Chicago Press. Through the use of large pretrained language models, we analyzed these letters to arrive at more contextual representations. This is to showcase how advanced computational frameworks can be utilized toward gaining additional insights, or validation. Computational tools can be used toward arriving at bigger and more meaningful research questions. 

# Methods and Approach
First, a tabular dataset of the letters to various correspondents with various attributes was constructed. Then, using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), a Pre-trained Language Model, we analyzed the evolution of topics and emotions represented in these documents over time.
